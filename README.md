Food how is a recipe book and shopping list that deploys as static files. For more information see [troyblank.com](http://troyblank.com/#portfolio:/specimens/2014/foodHow/ "Food How").

## Requirements

* node: 10.16.2

First thing you want to do is install all node packages run:

    yarn install

In order to build and run the project run:

    yarn start
    
## Test

    yarn test

## Adding recipes

To add a recipe simply make a new json file in ```static/recipes``` that follows this format:

    {
        "title": "Some Food",
        "meta": "This is a really good food.",
        "ingredients": [
            "[1 link to another recipe](/some/link)",
            "1 meat",
            "1 cup fruit (processed)",
            "&frac12; tsp spice"
        ],
        "directions": [
            { "text": "Mash ingredient together." },
            { "text": "Maybe throw in hot sauce (optional).", type: "optional" },
            { "text": "Eat." }
        ]
    }

Then add the new recipe to the list in ```static/recipes.js```

When adding recipes it's important to note that underscores will be used in lieu of spaces in file names. For example "Some_Food.json" will show up as "Some Food" to the user.

            ],
            "Stuffing": [
                "4 sprigs rosemary",
